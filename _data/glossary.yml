- name: Affine transform
  definition: "A transform that preserves parallel lines. That is, when the transform is applied to a pair of lines that are parallel, then the resulting transformed lines are also parallel. An affine transform, $T$, has the property that the transform of the line segment between a point $(x_1,y_1)$ and a point $(x_2,y_2)$ is the line between the points $T(x_1,y_1)$ and $T(x_2,y_2)$. Effectively, the transform of a line segment can be computed just by transforming its two endpoints. This makes affine transforms very efficient for computer graphics. Any affine transform can be represented as a composition of rotations, translations, and scalings."

- name: Shadow Mapping
  definition: "A technique for determining which parts of a scene are illuminated and which are in shadow from a given light source.

Along a given direction from the light source, the object that is illuminated by the light is the one that is closest to the light. The distance to that object is essentially encoded in the depth buffer. Objects at greater distance are in shadow."
