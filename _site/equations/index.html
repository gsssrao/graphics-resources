  <h4 id="Affine transform"><strong>Affine transform</strong></h4>
  <p>A transform that preserves parallel lines. That is, when the transform is applied to a pair of lines that are parallel, then the resulting transformed lines are also parallel. An affine transform, $T$, has the property that the transform of the line segment between a point $(x_1,y_1)$ and a point $(x_2,y_2)$ is the line between the points $T(x_1,y_1)$ and $T(x_2,y_2)$. Effectively, the transform of a line segment can be computed just by transforming its two endpoints. This makes affine transforms very efficient for computer graphics. Any affine transform can be represented as a composition of rotations, translations, and scalings.</p>

  <h4 id="Back face"><strong>Back face</strong></h4>
  <p>One of the two sides of a polygon in 3D. A polygon has two sides. One is taken to be the front face, and the other is the back face.

  <p>A bitmap (or raster) image is one of the two major graphic types (the other being vector image). Bitmap-based images are comprised of pixels in a grid.

  <p>A BRDF describes the reflectance properties of a surface by specifying the amount of radiance incident from one direction that is reflected into another direction, with respect to the surface normal. The main characteristics of a physically plausible BRDF are the symmetry between incident and reflected directions (Helmholtz reciprocity) and that the total reflected power for a given direction of incident radiation is less than or equal to the energy of the incident light (Energy conservation).</p>

A BSDF gives the probability that a light ray that arrives at point of space from one direction will leave that point heading in a another direction. The probability is a function of the two directions, the point, and the wavelength of the light. One kind of scattering is reflection of light from a surface.

  <h4 id="Diffuse Color"><strong>Diffuse Color</strong></h4>
  <p>Diffuse color is the most instinctive meaning of the color of an object. It is that essential color that the object reveals under pure white light.

  <p>A graphics technique in which an image is drawn off-screen, in a region of memory called an off-screen buffer or back buffer. When the image is drawn, it can be copied to the buffer that represents the contents of the screen, which is also known as the front buffer. In true double buffering, the image doesn't have to be copied; instead, the buffers can be swapped so that the back buffer becomes the front buffer, and the front buffer becomes the back buffer.</p>

<div class="course">
  <h4 id="Two-sided Lighting"><strong>Two-sided Lighting</strong></h4>
  <p>An option in OpenGL that allows the back face of a polygon to have different material properties from the front face. Also, when this option is on, the normal vector that is used in lighting calculations for the back face is taken to be the negative of the vector for the front face. (The negative of a vector points in the opposite direction.)</p>

<div class="course">
  <h4 id="Uniform Scaling"><strong>Uniform Scaling</strong></h4>
  <p>A scaling transformation in which the scaling factors in all directions are the same. Uniform scaling changes the size of an object without distorting its shape.</p>
  <hr />
</div>

<div class="course">
  <h4 id="UV unwrapping"><strong>UV unwrapping</strong></h4>
  <p>The process of flattening a 3D model's surface into a flat 2D plane in a contiguous, spatially coherent manner for texture mapping.</p>
  <hr />
</div>

<div class="course">
  <h4 id="UV coordinates"><strong>UV coordinates</strong></h4>
  <p>Coordinates in texture space, assigned as vertex attributes and/or calculated in vertex shaders, used for texture lookup, defining the mapping from texture space to a 3D model surface or any rendering primitive.</p>
  <hr />
</div>

  <h4 id="V"><strong>V</strong></h4>
  <p></p>
  <hr />
</div>

<div class="course">
  <h4 id="Vector"><strong>Vector</strong></h4>
  <p>An element of a vector space. Elements of a vector space can be added and can be multiplied by constants. For computer graphics, a vector is just a list or array containing two, three, or four numbers. </p>
  <hr />
</div>

<div class="course">
  <h4 id="Vector Graphics"><strong>Vector Graphics</strong></h4>
  <p>Shape-based graphics in which an image is represented as a collection of vectors. Contrast with <a href="#Bitmap Image">Raster Graphics</a>.</p>
  <hr />
</div>

<div class="course">
  <h4 id="Vertex"><strong>Vertex</strong></h4>
  <p>One of the points that define a geometric primitive, such as the two endpoints of a line segment or the three vertices of a triangle. (The plural is "vertices.") A vertex can be specified in a coordinate system by giving its x and y coordinates in 2D graphics, or its x, y, and z coordinates in 3D graphics.</p>
  <hr />
</div>

<div class="course">
  <h4 id="Vertex Shader"><strong>Vertex Shader</strong></h4>
  <p>A shader program that will be executed once for each vertex in a primitive. A vertex shader must compute the vertex coordinates in the clip coordinate system. It can also compute other properties, such as color.</p>
  <hr />
</div>

<div class="course">
  <h4 id="Viewing Transformation"><strong>Viewing Transformation</strong></h4>
  <p>The transformation in 3D graphics that maps world coordinates to eye coordinates. The viewing transform establishes the position, orientation, and scale of the viewer in the world.</p>
  <hr />
</div>

<div class="course">
  <h4 id="Viewport"><strong>Viewport</strong></h4>
  <p>The rectangular area in which the image for 2D or 3D graphics is displayed. The coordinates on the viewport are pixel coordinates, more properly called device coordinates since they are actual physical coordinates on the device where the image is being displayed.</p>
  <hr />
</div>

<div class="course">
  <h4 id="Viewport Transformation"><strong>Viewport Transformation</strong></h4>
  <p>In OpenGL, the final transformation from clip coordinates to device coordinates. The viewport transformation maps the clipping cube (the cube in 3D given by x, y, and z coordinates in the range from -1 to 1) to the viewport (the rectangle in the drawing surface where the image is rendered).</p>
  <hr />
</div>

<div class="course">
  <h4 id="View Volume"><strong>View Volume</strong></h4>
  <p>In OpenGL, the region is 3D space that is visible in the rendered image. For orthographic projections, the view volume is a rectangular solid. For perspective projection, the view volume is a frustum (truncated pyramid).</p>
  <hr />
</div>

<div class="extra">
  <h4 id="Voxels"><strong>Voxels</strong></h4>
  <p>An extension of pixels into 3 dimensions.</p>
  <hr />
</div>

<div class="course">
  <h4 id="View frustum"><strong>View frustum</strong></h4>
  <p>a truncated pyramid enclosing the subset of 3D space that projects onto a 'viewport' (a rectangular region in screen space, usually the entire screen)</p>
  <hr />
</div>

<div class="">

<div class="course">
  <h4 id="WebGL"><strong>WebGL</strong></h4>
  <p>A 3D graphics API for use on web pages. WebGL programs are written in the JavaScript programming language and display their images in HTML canvas elements. WebGL is based on OpenGL ES, the version of OpenGL for embedded systems, with a few changes to adapt it to the JavaScript language and the Web environment.</p>
  <hr />
</div>

<div class="course">
  <h4 id="Wireframe"><strong>Wireframe</strong></h4>
  <p>A style of drawing a polyhedron or polygonal mesh in which only the edges are drawn, resulting in an image made up of line segments.</p>
  <hr />
</div>

<div class="course">
  <h4 id="Wireframe rendering"><strong>Wireframe rendering</strong></h4>
  <p>A rendering of a 3D model displaying only edge connectivity; used in 3D modelling applications for greater interactive speed, and clarity for mesh editing.</p>
  <hr />

<div class="course">
  <h4 id="Z-Buffer/Depth-Buffer Test"><strong>Z-Buffer/Depth-Buffer Test</strong></h4>
  <p>The basic idea is to test the Z-depth of each surface to determine the closest (visible) surface. In this method each surface is processed separately one pixel position at a time across the surface. The depth values for a pixel are compared and the closest (smallest z) surface determines the color to be displayed in the frame buffer.</p>
  <hr />
</div>

<div class="course">
  <h4 id="Zoom"><strong>Zoom</strong></h4>
  <p>To display all or part of a graphical display image at a scale different from the scale of the previous image. Note: In zoom in, the scale is larger; in zoom out, the scale is smaller</p>
  <hr />
