### About Website

This website is an attempt to gather and document Computer Graphics and a bit of CHI related resources.

### Motivation

I have often felt that whenever I try to explore an area of study, there are various websites, tools, trivia, resources etc which are niche to that particular area and only known to people who have been working in that area for some time. In these cases Googling randomly doesn't help unless you have some knowledge of that area. Hence, in this website I have written some posts for introducing these tools and developing some basic background of this area.
